This project works on the backend of the zillow.com database which was given to us under a permissive license. We work on a VM in the google cloud. We use the housing transaction data in several projects:

* [Chicago House Prices and Crime](/project/ChicagoCrime)
* [Fertility and Location Choices](/project/Fertility)
