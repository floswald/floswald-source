      <description>In this research project we would like to contribute to a small and growing literature after Thaler (1978) that tries to establish a causal relationship between local crime and local house prices. The central aim of this literature is to this day the measurement of the willingness to pay of residents for crime reduction. In a wider sense, how much should a country spend on its criminal justice system, how much to spend on police forces?</description>
