The central aim of this literature is to this day the measurement of the willingness to pay of residents for crime reduction. In a wider sense, how much should a country spend on its criminal justice system, how much to spend on police forces? In order to frame this measurement exercise in the right way, it is important to know by how much local house prices decline, if there were a crime to happen close by. This is the exercise we propose to undertake here.\nIt seems to be a foregone conclusion that the occurrence of crime would reduce house prices in a certain area. Indeed, since Thaler (1978) it has become common to view crime as one of several neighborhood amenities that influence the value of any given property. Much like the existence of a good school or a nice park in an area, the absence of crime is a characteristic associated to a property that commands a higher sales price. Nevertheless it has remained difficult to cleanly identify a causal effect of crime on prices, mostly because of data limitations. This means that we still don’t have a reliable estimate of how large a price discount local crime implies. We have now access to an exclusive database at SciencesPo which we think allows us to make great progress in this dimension. Merging the ZTRAX database with Chicago crime data, we can identify the impact of crime at the census-block-date level.\nStatus Data: ZTRAX database is operational, merge with Crime data imminent. Theory: We propose a simple hedonic price model where criminal activity affects the amenity value of the local area. Analysis: We are running high-dim FE models at the moment.

Particularly, lenders reduced approval rates and loan sizes for affected mortgages by about 5 percent. Households, by contrast, did not increase their mortgage applications because of the law change. More importantly, the law change did not appear to have affected mortgage default and house foreclosure outcomes.
